# A Memorandum on Open Source Development

## What is this?

This is a teaser of the unpublished "The Open Source Founder's Memoir", which lures you into sponsoring my journey on open source development. At the end of the journey, hopefully I would have concluded the principles - the "dos and don'ts" of sustainable open source development. To be fair, I havenâ€™t reached there yet. Far away from it. But becoming my sponsor would grant you access to my unpublished memoir, which I hope would have something interesting for you to munch on - the philosophical grey matter of computer science, software development and open source.

## Why would you be interested?

Perhaps you also wanted to start an open source project, or want to decide you if you really wanted to. The interesting bit is, I quitted my job to start an open source project *and* poured substantial money into it early on. It was deliberate.

## Before you start an open source project

1. [Question yourself](1.%20Before%20you%20start/1.%20Question%20yourself.md)
1. [Aspire](1.%20Before%20you%20start/2.%20Aspire.md)
1. [Be pessimistic](1.%20Before%20you%20start/3.%20Be%20pessimistic.md)

## There are two facets of free-dom in open source: free as in beer and free as in public toilet
